Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

An interactive Excel dashboard built with PivotTables and PivotCharts to analyze sales performance by Year, Quarter, Segment, State, Category, Sub-Category, and Product. The dashboard surfaces core KPIs and allows quick drill-downs via slicers.

âœ¨ Highlights

KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Sale, Number of Orders

Interactive filters (slicers): Year, Quarter, Segment, State

Views: Category & Sub-Category performance, Top 10 Products, Sales by State map

Built entirely on PivotTables + PivotCharts (no VBA/macros required)

ðŸ§  What I Learned / Practiced

PivotTable design (grouping, Value Field Settings, Top N, Show Values As)

PivotChart selection and formatting for executive readability

Slicer connections across multiple pivots

Data exploration and cleaning (standardizing dates/categories, fixing duplicates, handling blanks)

Lightweight modeling in Excel for repeatable refreshes (optionally via Power Query)
